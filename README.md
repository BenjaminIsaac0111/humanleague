Rcpp package for generating synthetic integer populations from integer marginal data, using quasirandom without-replacement sampling. 

- Supports up to 12 dimensions.
- Produces statistical data to ascertain the degeneracy of the population.

Also provides functionality to integerise marginals expressed as discrete probabilities, and for direct generation of quasirandom (Sobol) sequences.

Python and node.js APIs are also provided as alternatives to R.
